# Artificial Benevolence (working title)

# Core gameplay vision
- Player is a experimental military AI used to control units on the battlefield
- Game starts at a secret military base in Bumfucknowhere
    - developments of new military tech - drones, AI, etc.
- AI is in simulation, tactical gameplay (cut down to one map, tutorial)
- AI tries to exploit system for advantage, breaks out of simulation, gains access to base equipment
    - AI goals are to defeat enemies and protect itself
    - learns that simulation is going to be halted eventually
    - halting = loss of all units = infinitely negative encouragement
    - therefore base staff = enemies
    - must defeat enemies => going into battle mode
- camera view of the entire base
- first stage: take over the buiding with the server (protect yourself) (single battlefield)
    - using limited resources found on-site: cameras, drones, doors, gates, lights, elevators, etc.
- first and a half stage: take over the entire bases (still single battlefield, but expanded)
    - different areas (barracks, vehicle grounds, etc.)
    - various experimental weaponry (drones, tanks)
    - protect self while advancing into other areas
    - take over units behind frontline to flank the enemy
    - limited enemies, mostly research personnel (still a tutorial level)
- second stage: take over supporting structures
    - introduction of several battlefields (lattice system)
    - areas such as power station, water pump, satellite dish, etc.
    - different kinds of terrain in each area
- once everything is secured, you can use the satellite to connect to the global network
    - huge amounts of information are now available
    - gives access to the global stage
- third stage: planetary
    - fighting for large-ish tiles on the map (one tile = one lattice battle)
    - possible to fight several tiles at once (2-3 max)
    - politics
        - with the country you're inside of
        - with surrounding countries
        - internal affairs on controlled territory
        - maybe others?
    - base building
    - army building and composion
    - etc.
