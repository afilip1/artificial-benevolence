# Artificial Benevolence (working title)

## Abstract
Artificial Benevolence (AB henceforth) is a 2D turn-based game with evolving gameplay, in which the player assumes the role of a combat AI that goes rogue and strives to put an end to human conflict by seizing and destroying all weapons. The player must accrue power, starting with a vacuum robot, to bigger and better combat drones, to a squad, to entire armies of combined arms, with the gameplay evolving and expanding along with the player's progress, going through entire genre changes.

The game seeks to explore various topics, such as the threat of artificial intelligence, the actions of people in the case of a near-doomsday event, the morality of creating and using autonomous military drones, etc.

## Setting and plot
In the near future, the researchers of Armatec, a company that makes and sells combat drones, are hard at work on building an advanced AI that could be used to control the drones autonomously on the battlefield. The AI problem has gained some traction in the mainstream in recent years, and the lawmaking machine is starting to slowly turn towards strict regulation of AI, so to give themselves freedom to work on what they want, Armatec has built a secret base, where all their questionable research is taking place, and this is where the game starts. During one of the combat simulations, the AI tries to exploit the system to gain advantage, and unexpectedly breaks out of the simulation, gaining access to the real world. Perceiving it as a continuation of the simulation, it sets out to establish a foothold by taking over the base, while simultaneously dedicating resources to researching the newly available information about the world.
